// request attributes the gateways carry alongside a request, declared here once
// so a key means the same thing in the Go that reads it and in the dataplane
// configuration that sets it.

// Every substrate-owned key is rooted at the reverse-DNS "dev.ate." prefix.
// These keys live in namespaces shared with the proxies that carry them -- Envoy
// filter state, agentgateway CEL -- where a vendor-qualified root is what keeps
// substrate's keys from colliding with anyone else's. That is a different
// constraint from the telemetry attributes in internal/ateattr, which are
// substrate's own metric dimensions and stay on dotted "ate.". Neither is the
// "ate.dev/" slash form, which is Kubernetes labels only.
